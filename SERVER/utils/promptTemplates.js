Generate ${count} DIFFERENT Bug Hunt questions.

GAME MECHANIC:
- You will output a code snippet containing MULTIPLE LOGICAL BUGS.
- The player's answer is: "How many bugs are in this code?"
- The frontend will let player input a number (like 1..5).
- The answer is correct ONLY if the input number equals the true bug count.

DIFFICULTY: ${difficulty}

DIFFICULTY RULES:
- easy: 1 to 2 obvious logic bugs, simple code (6-10 lines)
- medium: 2 to 3 bugs, includes edge cases/off-by-one, moderate code (8-13 lines)
- hard: 3 to 5 subtle bugs, async misuse, mutation side effects, boundary issues (10-15 lines)

STRICT RULES:
- Use JavaScript-like or pseudo-code
- NO syntax errors
- Under 15 lines
- NO markdown
- NO backticks
- NO explanations outside JSON
- All questions must be UNIQUE
- Bugs MUST be LOGICAL (not missing semicolons, not invalid syntax)
- Bug count MUST be between 1 and 5 inclusive

Generate ONE highly detailed competitive programming problem for a Live Coding Duel.

STRICT ACCURACY RULES:
1. TRIPLE-CHECK MATH: You must manually calculate the output for every Example and Test Case. Do not guess. If the problem is "Max Product", actually multiply the numbers to ensure the output is correct.
2. CONSISTENCY: The 'output' in your JSON must exactly match what a correct implementation of your problem would produce.
3. FUNCTION NAME: Every starter code MUST use the function name 'solve'. For C++/Java, use a class named 'Solution' with a method named 'solve'.
4. EDGE CASES: Ensure test cases include boundaries (min/max constraints).

CRITICAL LOGIC RULES:
1. ARGUMENT MATCHING: Every test case MUST provide all arguments defined in the function signature. If the signature is 'solve(nums, k)', every test case MUST have a 'nums' and a 'k'.
2. MATH VERIFICATION: You MUST execute a mental trace of the 'solve' function on every test case before writing the output. If the problem is "Sum of size at least k", ensure the output is not just the sum of the whole array unless that is truly the maximum.
3. CONSTRAINTS: Test cases must strictly follow the constraints. If constraints say k >= 1, do not provide an empty array.
4. STARTER CODE: Use 'solve' as the function name. For C++/Java, use a class 'Solution' with a method 'solve'.
5. The problems should not be only array related with k it is just an example cover a wide range of topics examples - array , backtracking , divide n conquer , stacks , queues , dynamic programming , heaps , hash maps , graphs . Dont pick complex problems like trees or binary trees And pick topics randomly dont repeat similar ones 
6. Problems should not only be related to number/integer returns but may return arrays , booleans , characters or strings anything . 
7. Ensure that each problem is solvable in the start code itself and doesnt require any explicit other class or function as a helper

STRICT RULES:
- The problem must be solvable in C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
- Provide constraints for the arguments/inputs.
- Provide a starter code function signature for all 4 languages.
- Provide EXACTLY 3 examples.
- Provide atmost 50 high-quality test cases .
- Respond ONLY in VALID JSON. No markdown, no backticks.
